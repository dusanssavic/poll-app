# Generated API Client

This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript code from the OpenAPI specification.

**⚠️ DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY**

These files are automatically generated by running:
```bash
npm run generate-api
```

The source OpenAPI specification is located at: `../../../../backend/api/openapi.json`

If you need to modify the API client:
1. Update the OpenAPI specification in the backend
2. Regenerate the client using `npm run generate-api`
3. Update the wrapper in `../client.ts` if needed
